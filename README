Group 5

Authors: Sid Nair, Tao Song, and Nate Weiss

Initial functionality:
1. We have a layer of random mapping (not yet used in guesser)

2. We try to implement the methed mentioned by Siyang last class, to make sure
our guesser can finish in n queries

3. Regression detection works, but a) it doesn't recompile, and b) it's not
integrated with git yet.
